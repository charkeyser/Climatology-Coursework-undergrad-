# Climatology-Coursework-undergrad-
The purpose of this repo is to hold code for undergraduate coursework in climatology for grading and reproduction purposes (mostly Python, probably). Most Python will be generated using Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), and any R will be from RStudio.

# setup/use-
"git clone https://github.com/charkeyser/Climatology-Coursework-undergrad-.git" OR "git remote add origin 'previous URL'"  
"cd Climatology-Coursework-undergrad-"

if applicable:  
"conda env create -f <environment-name>.yml && conda activate <env-name>"

All Python should be runnable in Jupyter Notebook without setting up an external environment

Python: 3 (ipykernel)
